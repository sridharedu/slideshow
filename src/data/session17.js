    title: "Introduction to Spring Boot",
    points: [
      "Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.",
      "It simplifies the development of Spring applications by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and a convention-over-configuration approach.",
      "It aims to get you up and running with minimal fuss, allowing you to focus on business logic."
    ],
    keepInMind: "Spring Boot is designed to make Spring development faster and more efficient."
  },
  {
    title: "Spring Framework vs. Spring Boot",
    points: [
      "**Spring Framework**: Provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. It's a foundation.",
      "**Spring Boot**: Builds on top of the Spring Framework, providing a faster and more efficient way to build Spring applications. It's a specific way to use Spring.",
      "Spring Boot simplifies dependency management, configuration, and deployment compared to traditional Spring applications."
    ],
    keepInMind: "Spring Boot is not a replacement for Spring, but rather an extension that streamlines its usage."
  },
  {
    title: "Embedded Servers and Databases",
    points: [
      "Spring Boot includes embedded servlet containers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, eliminating the need for separate server installations.",
      "This simplifies deployment as the application can be packaged as a single executable JAR file.",
      "It also supports in-memory databases like H2 for development and testing, making it easy to get started without a full database setup."
    ],
    keepInMind: "Embedded servers and databases significantly reduce the setup and deployment overhead for Spring Boot applications."
  },
  {
    title: "No XML Configurations (Mostly)",
    points: [
      "One of Spring Boot's key features is its strong emphasis on convention over configuration, minimizing the need for explicit XML configuration.",
      "It leverages auto-configuration and annotations to automatically configure many aspects of your application based on the dependencies present.",
      "While XML is still supported, most Spring Boot applications are configured using Java-based configuration and annotations."
    ],
    keepInMind: "Spring Boot aims to reduce boilerplate code and configuration, making development more streamlined."
  },
  {
    title: "Actuator: Monitoring and Management",
    points: [
      "Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to monitor and manage your application.",
      "It exposes operational information about the running application, such as health, metrics, info, and environment properties, through various endpoints.",
      "Actuator is invaluable for DevOps practices, enabling easy integration with monitoring and alerting systems."
    ],
    keepInMind: "Actuator is a powerful tool for gaining insights into your application's runtime behavior and health."
  },
  {
    title: "Horizontal Scaling and Microservices",
    points: [
      "Spring Boot is well-suited for building microservices architectures due to its lightweight nature and ease of deployment.",
      "It facilitates horizontal scaling by allowing you to easily create multiple instances of your services.",
      "Combined with Spring Cloud, it provides tools for service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance in distributed systems."
    ],
    keepInMind: "Spring Boot is a popular choice for developing scalable and resilient microservices."
  },
  {
    title: "YAML and Properties File Formats",
    points: [
      "Spring Boot supports both `.properties` and `.yml` (YAML) file formats for externalizing configuration.",
      "YAML is often preferred for its human-readable, hierarchical structure, especially for complex configurations.",
      "Spring Boot provides a clear order of precedence for loading properties from different sources."
    ],
    keepInMind: "Choose the configuration format that best suits your team's preferences and the complexity of your application's settings."
  },
  {
    title: "Pre-defined Keys for Configuration Properties",
    points: [
      "Spring Boot provides a wide range of pre-defined configuration properties that you can use in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.",
      "These properties allow you to configure various aspects of your application, such as server port, database connection, logging levels, etc.",
      "Examples: `server.port`, `spring.datasource.url`, `logging.level.root`."
    ],
    keepInMind: "Leveraging pre-defined properties simplifies configuration and ensures consistency across Spring Boot applications."
